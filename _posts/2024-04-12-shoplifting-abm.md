This project is part of the coursework from the simluation for research module. Utilizing Netlogo, the code creates a simulation in which security guard's probaility of detecting a shoplifting and shoplifter's probability of detecting a security guard nearby are manipulated. See more details at its repository [shoplifting ABM] (https://github.com/cyfangus/abm_shoplifting).
