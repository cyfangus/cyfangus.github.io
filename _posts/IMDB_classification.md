This project is part of the coursework from the applied data science module. By training models from a large dataset containing 25k IMDB movie reviews that have been labeled as either positive or negative, it predicts another 25k movie reviews to be positive or negative. For more details, please refer to the corresponding repository [IMDB_sentiment_classification](https://github.com/cyfangus/IMDB_sentiment_classification).
