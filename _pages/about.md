Hi, my name is Angus. I am from Hong Kong and currently living in London, UK. I am a PhD researcher at the University College London Department of Securit and Crime Science. My research focuses on understanding how individuals' identifications with social groups influence their perceived fairness and legitimacy of the police. My PhD project incorporates a wide variety of methodologies including meta-analysis, in-depth interviews, and experiments (A/B test).

As I have gained more experience in data analysis and coding, I am keen to learn about how data can be used to create a better world, including but not limited to the crime and security field. As an early-stage data scientist, I have completed projects across a variety of topics using R and Python to conduct different statistical analyses, including linear regressions, path analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM). In the meantime, I have also audited the applied data science module in my department to better equip myself with the essential knowledge and skills in the field of data science and machine learning.

If you are interested to know more about me, please take a look at different tabs on my website. You can also find my latest CV under the tab "CV". Thank you.
