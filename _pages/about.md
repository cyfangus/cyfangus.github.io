Hi, my name is Angus. I am originally from Hong Kong and currently based in London, UK. I am a PhD researcher at the Department of Security and Crime Science at University College London. I have a strong background in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, with hands-on experience in Python and R. Throughout my academic research, I have developed a deep understanding of how to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, particularly in real-world contexts such as social dynamics in policing. My PhD research applies advanced statistical techniques to understand the role of social psychology in the policing context.

In addition to my research in psychology and criminology, I have acquired valuable machine learning and data analysis skills through postgraduate courses and online certifications. These certifications have equipped me with hands-on experience in tools such as scikit-learn for model development, TensorFlow for deep learning, and SQL for database management. I have also gained expertise in using data visualization tools, such as Tableau and PowerBI, and have worked with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis. Recently, I have expanded my skill set by learning to work with Large Language Models (LLMs), gaining experience in tasks such as topic modelling and sentiment analysis, and understanding how to leverage these models for advanced NLP applications.

I am eager to bring my technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and passion for data science to contribute to impactful projects and drive data-driven decisions within a collaborative team setting.
