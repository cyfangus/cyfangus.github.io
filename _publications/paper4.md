### Abstract
The purpose of this study is to take a life course perspective to explore how experiences at different life course stages of substance users and contextual factors influence their drug use behaviors. Using the life history narrative approach to interview 31 persons who were taking part in rehabilitation treatment in Hong Kong, this study maps out substance use trajectory into four stages (onset, persistence, escalation, and desistance) addressing three interrelated themes: (1) substance use behavior characteristics, (2) critical life events, (3) and social and structural factors. The results showed an interaction between substance use behaviors and their experience in different life stages. Because substance use has become more hidden in the stage of persistence and escalation, particularly in dense cities like Hong Kong, early social support is advocated to be provided in prevention and rehabilitation, such as offering better vocational training support and follow-up service to rebuild relationships with families.
