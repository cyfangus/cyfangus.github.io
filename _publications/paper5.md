### Abstract
#### Objectives
To systematically review the evidence of the relationship between policing and collective efficacy.

#### Methods
A systematic review and meta-analysis synthesising data from 16 studies (4 experimental/quasi-experimental, 12 observational) assessing the relationship between policing and collective efficacy.

#### Results
Overall, police trustworthiness was the only measure of policing that was significantly associated with collective efficacy. People who thought the police were an effective and supportive resource perceived greater collective efficacy in their neighbourhoods.

#### Conclusions
The contribution of policing to collective efficacy seems to be about supporting communities by providing a trustworthy presence, which may reassure people that the police will be there if needed.
